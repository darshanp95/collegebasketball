Analytics for college basketball coaches and salaries


This project was completed by Patrina Bailey and Darshan Padmanabhan. The primary purpose of this project was for us to build a functioning
application using python and SQL. Our objective when starting the project were to get data, store that data, analyze the data, and display
our results.

In order to get the data we scraped a website called sport-reference.com/cbb. This website has up to date statistics on all college
basketball teams. We scraped the data using the BeatifulSoup scraping library.

Once we had scraped the data we created a database model using SQLAlchemy. We then populated the database and had the ability to iterate 
over the data. 

Next we created a combination Flask/Dash application to display our results. We hope you enjoy looking at them!
